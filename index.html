		<h1>The battle of chill and char vs. eclipse</h1>
		<p>All the Wizards took their votes. For Chill and char or Eclipse, for whoever was picked they would be on Chill and char or Eclipse’s team .  Over in shipwreck shore the titan knew about the battle.  As a kid he read a prophecy  about Chill and char and eclipse battling each other and then the dragons giving up and battling him. They were destined to kill him.  He was going to have to work hard if he wanted to survive.  Back in Lamplite town, the battle has begun.  Blood was spilling everywhere.  Attack, attack, attack yelled the wizards then something happened that stopped there heart’s……………. they both died.
